# 🇯🇵 Organic Japanese Transscripts

This repository contains video transscripts of the YouTube channel [Organic Japanese with Cure Dolly](https://www.youtube.com/@organicjapanesewithcuredol49).
All transcripts were retrieved via the YouTube API and are available in the `transcripts` directory.

I hope this repository will be useful for those who are learning Japanese and want to use the videos as a learning resource.

頑張ってね!
