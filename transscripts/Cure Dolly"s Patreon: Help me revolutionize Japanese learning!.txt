Konnichiwa.
My name is Cure Dolly and my mission is to revolutionize the learning of Japanese.
I just started a Patreon.
What is a Patreon?
It's a way that people can support creators like me.
Well, most of them are human, so perhaps not quite like me, but you get the idea.
Why do I need support?
Well, a lot of people have trouble with the
sound quality and general quality of these
video lessons, and I don't have the money
for equipment to improve things very much.
Together we could make things a lot better.
I also have various projects in mind that
would require some investment.
But more generally, as you can probably imagine, making these video lessons is a big job.
For it to be sustainable in the long term,
it would really be necessary to have some
financial support.
I only receive a fraction of the cover price
when my books sell, so that really doesn't
cover things.
Now please let me say that I don't want anyone to feel that they ought to be supporting me
or feel bad if they can't support me.
I value each and every one of my subscribers and viewers.
If you give me a thumbs up or a nice comment I'm very grateful.
If you don't, I'm still grateful to you for attending my lesson.
I know what it's like to not have much money and I'm never going to put vital information
behind a paywall.
If you can support me, that's wonderful.
If you can't, please don't ever worry about it.
Issho ni ganbarimashou ne.
Let's go forward in Japanese together.
Kore kara mo yoroshiku onegai shimasu.
