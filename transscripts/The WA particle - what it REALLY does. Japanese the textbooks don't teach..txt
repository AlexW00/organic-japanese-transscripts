Hello, pretty peoples. KawaJapa no
Kyua Dorii desu.
I am Cure Dolly from KawaJapa.
Today we are going to look at the
Japanese wa-particle. The textbooks
actually don't do a very bad job
of explaining the wa-particle
In fact they do quite a good one, but
they leave out certain vital information
which means that many Japanese sentences
become hard for the foreign learner to
understand. Let us start off with a joke
that is common among foreign Japanese
learners. This joke is that "watashi wa
unagi desu" means "I am an eel".
Actually, when said in a restaurant what
it means is "I will have eel to eat', but
but "watashi wa Nihonjin desu" means "I am
a Japanese", doesn't it?
So logically shouldn't "watashi wa
unagi desu" mean "I am an eel"? I have even
seen teachers write that it does in fact
mean "I am an eel" but by some kind of
colloquial contraction it is understood
in the restaurant to mean "I will have
eel". This is simply not true,
and we will explain why. The first thing
we need to understand here is something
that may come as a surprise to many
people.
I learned it first of all from Jay
Rubin-sensei in his book "Making Sense of
Japanese: What the Textbooks Don't Tell
You". This fact is that the wa-particle
never marks the grammatical subject of a
sentence. The grammatical subject, as I
have explained before, means the thing
that is doing or being something, so if I
say "watashi wa Nihonjin desu" – " 'I' am being Japanese" – now,
doesn't the wa-particle appear to mark
the grammatical subject of a sentence
in this case and in many others? The
textbooks actually explain the wa-particle,
which marks the topic not the
subject of a sentence, in this way: they
explain it as meaning "as for" or "speaking
of". So, "watashi wa Nihonjin desu"
means "As for me, I am Japanese". This is
precisely correct, so let's just take
that sentence in English and break it
down. "As for me, I am Japanese". What is
this subject, the doer, of that sentence
grammatically? It is "I", isn't it? It's not
"me".
In fact you can't use "me" in this way. You
can't say "Me am Japanese" – that's not
correct English. "As for me, I am Japanese":
the subject is "I", not "me". Wa works in
precisely the same way.
It means "watashi wa zero pronoun ga Nihonjin
desu". We learned about the zero particle
last week, and this is precisely why I
taught the zero particle before teaching
the wa-particle, because you can't
understand what the wa-particle
really does until you understand the
zero particle. So it might be a good idea
if you haven't watched the zero particle
lesson to go back and watch that before
continuing with this one. All right, so
precisely what Rubin-sensei did not
mention in his book was this: he said
that the wa-particle never marks the
grammatical subject, the doer or the be-er,
of a sentence. The thing he did not
mention is that the reason it does not
and cannot mark the doer or the be-er of
a sentence because
only one particle can ever do that and
that particle is ga. So where we see
wa appearing to mark the subject of a
sentence – which it often does – what in
fact is happening is that the zero
pronoun is inside that sentence and it
is taking the necessary ga, the ga that,
as I explained in the first lesson, every
single Japanese sentence has to have
because every Japanese sentence must
have a ga-marked subject, a doer and the
thing done or the thing that it is. So, let's
take another simple example just to make
clear how it works. If I say "kore wa
pen desu",
what I'm saying is "kore wa zero ga
pen desu" – "As for this, it is a pen." Now, in
both these sentences, the Nihonjin wa and
the pen wa, the wa is actually defining the ga
for us. The wa-marked noun tells us what
the ga-marked grammatical subject of the
sentence is going to be, but this is not
always the case by any means, and
a good example of that is "watashi
wa unagi desu". What that means is "As
for me, it is an eel."  "Watashi wa zero
ga unagi desu" – "As for me, 'it' is an eel."
And what is "it"? "It" is the thing we're talking about.
It's the thing I'm going to eat. How do we
know that? We know it from context. Three
people are sitting at a restaurant table
and the waiter is standing there with
her notebook, so we know that what we are
talking about is what we are going to
eat. As for me, it's an eel –"watashi wa zero ga
unagi desu". So even when the
subject of the sentence
has not been mentioned, we may still know
it from context and that defines the
zero pronoun. Now, some people
may be thinking, isn't that very obscure and
Japanese? How is one supposed to know that?
Well, no, it's not obscure and Japanese.
It's exactly the way "it" works in English.
if you come into my class with a frog
and I look at you and I say "Take it out,"
you know what "it" means in this sentence.
It means the frog. You can pretend you
don't know, but I wouldn't recommend it
So you see how we can understand the
ga-marked subject, even when it is invisible,
from context. If I rush up to you in the
street and say, "watashi wa unagi desu",
then I really am saying that I am an eel,
and you probably think there is
something wrong with me, but in the context
of the restaurant we know that the ga-marked
subject is something else. It's the thing
we're talking about, the thing we're going
to eat. So we see that wa can define
the ga-marked subject but it doesn't have to
do that. What is it that it's really
doing all the time? It is telling what we
decide the topic of the sentences is. So we
might say, "Doyoubi wa Toukyou ni
ikimasu" or we might say,
"Toukyou wa doyoubi ni ikimasu."
Both of those sentences mean the same thing – "I'm
going to Tokyo on Saturday" – but
they change the topic, the thing that's
actually under discussion. In the first
case we are saying, "As for Saturday, what's
happening is I'm going to Tokyo", and
in the second one we're saying, "As for
Tokyo, I'm going down on Saturday", and we
can just notice that in neither of these
sentences is the ga-marked subject visible.  It
is "watashi" or "I", and in neither of these
sentences does the wa tell us
what the ga-marked subject is. The ga-marked subject
is known from context. When we just say
"going to do something", we know that
that's usually going to be me unless
there's some reason to believe it
isn't. Now, there is one more thing I
would like you to observe about the
words on the board and that is that
where we place the wa-particle does
not affect the logic of the sentence. It
affects the stress or emphasis. More
exactly, it affects what is the topic of
the sentence. But it does not affect the
logic. It does not affect who is doing
what to whom. It does not affect what is
being done. It does not affect what is
actually taking place in the sentence,
because that is not the job of wa. That
is the job of ga and its associates.
This is something else that the textbooks do
not explain properly, and it will be the
subject of our next lesson. Please
remember that the course book for this
course is "Unlocking Japanese". You can get
it at Amazon in paperback or Kindle
editions, and it will help you to really
understand and internalize all the
things we are covering in this course.
Thank you for attending this lesson.
