Hello, pretty peoples. KawaJapa no Kyua Dorii desu.
I am Cure Dolly from KawaJapa. Today we are going to talk about the particle
ni. 
Kinetic RWBY-san thanks me for
making it clear how the different uses
of the particle wa are all tied to its
core function, and she says, "The other
thing that has been hard for me to get a
proper handle on is ni, mostly because of
its sheer versatility." Now, ni is indeed a
very versatile particle, but most of its
more basic functions do tie together
with one core functionality, and that is
that ni is what I call the destination
particle. When you first encounter ni,
it's probably as a literal destination,
isn't it? "Watashi wa kouen ni ikimashita."
– "I went to the park." The park was
the destination of my going, the literal
destination, and we also use it for a
thing that has achieved its destination
and remains there. "Watashi wa kouen ni
imashita." – "I was at the park." I went
there – that was my destination – and now I am
there. We use it also in the same way
for inanimate objects.
"Hon wa teeburu no ue ni arimashita." – "There was a book on the table," or literally,
"On the on of the table a book existed." 
Somebody put it there at some point –
that was its destination. At some future
point someone will take it away, but
currently it is at its arrived, completed
destination. Now, if we're doing anything
at the park rather than simply being
there, we have to use de: "Kouen de hon
wo yonda." – "At the park I read a book." But so long as we are treating it simply as the
destination to which we went or the
destination at which we have arrived
and remain, we use ni. We use ni for
either riding a train or getting on a
train. "Densha ni norimashita" can
mean "I got on the train" or it can mean "I
rode on the train," and you see these are
the two uses of ni: to get on the train –
the train is our destination; to ride the
train – why do we say that when we are
taking the action of riding the train?
Well, simply riding the train is not
an action, is it? The train moves. The
train moves at 200 miles an hour, but we
don't move at all. If we throw a ball
into the air, it does not fly backwards
in the train at 200 miles an hour – it
falls back into our hand. That is
because in relation to the train we are
stationary, and although this is the
theory of relativity and people didn't
know this at an earlier time, it is a fact
of human experience. So to ride the
train is simply a question of being, just
as sitting in a room is simply a
question of being. Now, so far we have
talked about ni as a literal destination
in space, but it can be a more figurative
destination. If we look at the
sentence: "Kouen ni asobi ni
ikimashita,"  we see two nis and they
are both marking a kind of destination.
"Kouen ni ikimashita" obviously is the
straightforward destination marker. The
park was the place I went to. "I went to
the park to play." "Kouen ni ikimashita"
marks the physical destination; "asobi
ni" marks the ultimate destination of
the action, its intention, its aim, its
destination. The destination of going was
the park, but the destination of the
entire action "going to the park", its aim,
was to play. "Kouen ni asobi ni ikimashita." Now, once we understand that kind
of figurative destination, we also
understand why ni marks the indirect
object of a sentence. "Booru wo Mary ni nageta." – "I
threw a ball at or to Mary." The ball is
the thing I actually threw, but the
ultimate destination of that action was
Mary. In English we say "I threw the ball
at Mary," "I threw the ball to Mary, "
or even "I dropped the ball on Mary." In
Japanese we always use the same particle, ni, so it's in fact rather simpler.  Ni
in this case is marking the ultimate
destination of the action. Now, from this
targeting or destination concept we can
also understand the way ni is used with words
like naru, to become. "Hime wa kaeru ni narimashita." – "The princess turned into a
frog". "Watashi wa isha ni naritai." – "I wish to
become a doctor." In each of these cases,
ni is marking the target, the destination
of the transformation, isn't it? A frog is
what the princess turned into, a doctor is
what I wish to become: the target of that
transformation. You can also use the
active suru in these cases rather than
the passive naru. You can turn
something into something else, and the
target of that transformation is always
going to be marked by ni. Now, 
understanding this also helps us to
understand another aspect of ni, which
is its use with so-called na-adjectives.
If you use ni in place of na with a
na-adjective, it becomes not an adjective
but an adverb. For example, if we say
"shizuka na onnanoko", we are
saying "the quiet girl", but if we say
"shizuka ni aruita", we are saying
"walked quietly". If a teacher in an anime
says "Shizuka ni!" that means "Be quiet!"
literally it's short for "Shizuka ni 
shite kudasai": "Please be quiet",
literally "Please do quietly" or more
naturally,
"Please act quietly / Please act in a quiet
manner", so you see ni here is marking the
target of the transformation of the
action. If we say, "Kanojo wa
kirei ni mieta" : "She looked pretty", 
the actual structure of that sentence,
as you can see, is "Kanojo ga (the
actor) looked – she looked – and "kirei ni"  is
telling us more about the way she looked.
"She appeared" –
how did she appear? "She appeared pretty." The target of her appearance was
prettiness – the target of that
transformation. We can also see how this
connects to the use of ni to mark the
indirect object. We say "Booru wo Mary ni
nageta" – "I threw the ball at Mary." The action is
throwing the ball and the ultimate
target of that action is Mary, isn't it?
In this case, "Kanojo wa kirei ni mieta" – the actual action is "the girl appeared", but
the ultimate target of that action is
prettiness. She appeared – how did she
appear? She appeared pretty. That's the
ultimate target, that's the target of the
transformation of the action. She
appeared in a pretty way;  pretty is how
she appeared. All right, so you can see,
in the notion of targeting, I think we can
understand most of the common functions of ni. In relation to human interaction,
there are some other things to consider,
but that really would be opening a fresh
subject. So that would be something
perhaps for another lesson. Please
remember that the coursework for this
course of lessons is "Unlocking Japanese".
You can get it at Amazon in paperback or
Kindle editions, and we recommend reading
the book along with following this
course. Thank you once again for
attending this lesson. Kore kara mo yoroshiku onegai shimasu. Class
dismissed.
