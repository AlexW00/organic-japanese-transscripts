Hello, pretty peoples. KawaJapa no Kyua Dorii desu. I am Cure Dolly from KawaJapa.
Today we are going to talk about the
most important single topic in learning
Japanese and that is the structure of
the language itself. The first thing I
want to say about this is that the
structure of Japanese is very, very
simple – much simpler than English
structure or French structure or Spanish
structure. It's very consistent, it has
very few exceptions, and it is very, very
logical – and you can't say that for many
languages. The second thing I want to say
is that the reason it does not seem
simple is because the standard textbooks
and schools don't actually tell you what
that structure is. Instead of telling
what Japanese structure is, they tell you
what English structure is and try to
describe Japanese in terms of that. And
it doesn't work very well. It's rather
like trying to do electronics with the
kitchen knife instead of the correct
screwdriver. In order to understand what
Japanese structure actually is, you
have to look at Japanese as if it were
Japanese and not English, because that is
what it actually is. It takes a little
effort in the first place, but not a
great deal, and it makes the language
simpler forever afterwards. All right then, let's
look at what Japanese structure actually
is. Now, as I explained in our very first
lesson, the fundamental structure of
every single Japanese sentence is the
same. It has a shugo and a jutsugo. It has
the thing that is doing or being
something and the thing that it is being
or doing, and those two things are always
connected by the same particle, the
fundamental logical particle, ga. That
is the structure of Japanese. Now, problems arise. You can't always see the ga in a
sentence, and I explained this completely
in my lesson on the zero particle and
the zero pronoun. Once you understand
that, you can understand how every
Japanese sentence is those two things
linked together by ga. Now, certain other
apparent problems can arise. The first
one is very, very normal, and it is that,
as in any language, sentences can become more complex. For example, we may have a
compound sentence which is two complete logical sentences joined together. In
English for example, we may say, "I went to the shops and bought some bread." We call
that a sentence, but as you see it is in
fact two complete logical sentences
joined together:  "I went to the shops" –
the doer is I, and going to the shops is
what the doer does – "and bought some bread" – the doer again is I,
and the thing done is buying bread. That's very simple, but it can become much more
complex. We can say, "I went to the shops that are just across the road from the
amusement park and bought some bread,
which turned out not to be very good."
Yet still, the fundamental structure is
those two logical sentences: "I went to
the shops" and "I bought some bread."
It's the same in Japanese. The only
difference is that in English we
sometimes put the clauses that modify
the doer and the thing being done before
the subject and sometimes after it. In
Japanese they always come before.
Everything modifying anything comes
before it. So once you get used to it, it is very, very
simple. The real problem, however, is not these
natural complications of language. It is
the fact that the way Japanese is taught
completely obscures the structure of the
language. Japanese grammar is taught as
if it were English grammar and that
completely obscures the structure in
some cases – and of course if you obscure the structure in some cases, you throw
doubt and confusion onto all cases. Let
me go into anime mode to explain the
problem. So, let's see what goes wrong.
Let's take a simple sentence of the
kind that you learn from very early on:
"Watashi wa koohii ga suki desu."
We are told that that means "I like
coffee" – and it doesn't. "I like coffee"
is what you would say in English, but it
is not what that sentence means. If it
did mean that, it would throw Japanese
grammar into complete confusion and that's
exactly what it does. Because what's
going on here? We are asked to believe
that the wa is marking the subject –
the actor, the doer – and that the ga is doing
what? – it's somehow linking coffee and the act of liking together, but the act of
liking here is not a verb, it's actually an
adjective. What's actually going on here
is that the "watashi wa" is not the
subject of the sentence; it's simply the
non-logical topic. I explained about
non-logical topics in my lesson on the
wa particle. So the topic is "watashi wa" –
 speaking of me. "Speaking of me,
coffee is pleasing." Coffee is the subject
of the sentence and that's why it's
marked by ga. Coffee is doing something
or being something and what it is doing
is being pleasing. Who is it being
pleasing to? Well, it might be being pleasing
to anyone, but we have set the topic as I,
so we can take it that it's being pleasing
to me. It's really as simple as that. This
isn't the way we would say it in English,
but it's actually the way, or very close to
the way, that we would say it in Spanish.
If we say "Me gusta el tequila," what we
are saying is "To me, tequila is pleasing."
We're not saying "I like tequila" and if
you think it is saying that, which is
also what the textbooks tell you, you're
going to get very confused about how
Spanish grammar works. Unfortunately in
Japanese the problem is a lot bigger,
because an awful lot of Japanese
sentences work this way. Japanese is much
happier to allow the doer, the actor, the
be-er of the sentence to be an object or
a condition rather than a person. English always wants an ego
at the centre of the sentence if you can
possibly have one, but Japanese doesn't,
and we're going to find that in various
different kinds of Japanese sentence. And
if we can't understand that, we can't
understand Japanese. Oh! here I am back to
3D. All right, now let's take an
example
of a case which really is a verb, in
this case the verb wakaru, wakarimasu.
And let's take a sentence that's
very textbook-like: "Watashi wa hon ga
wakarimasu," which is usually
translated as "I understand the book." And
if you've been paying attention, you can
see that it can't possibly mean that. The
ga is given to the book, so the book is
the actor in this sentence. What does it
actually mean? If you look up the word
wakaru in a Japanese-English
dictionary, you will see as the primary
definition: understand, perceive, grasp.
However, if you look it up in a Japanese
dictionary, you will see the primary
definition is meihaku ni naru, in other words, become clear, be understandable. So
what this sentence actually means: "watashi wa hon ga wakaru" is "In relation to me,
the book is understandable." Once again,
watashi wa is the non-logical topic and
the sentence, which is a comment on that
topic, is "the book is understandable." This
actually isn't even impossible in
English, is it? But the English prejudice
for putting an ego at the center of the
action is so strong that they insist on
translating it in a way that makes the
Japanese completely confusing. Ga always
does the same thing. As a matter of fact,
it is even possible in Japanese to use
wakaru to mean understand, but if
you do that, guess what?
you have to move that ga. If you
want to use wakaru in the sense of
meaning understand, then you have to give the ga to watashi: "Watashi ga hon
wo wakaru" or simply "hon wo wakaru," which implicitly throws the ga
onto the zero pronoun watashi. Just out of interest,
I took a look at "hon ga wakaru" versus "hon wo wakaru" on Google, and the frequency
of "hon ga wakaru" is approximately ten
times that of
"hon wo wakaru". And there is some debate among Japanese people as to whether
expressions like "hon wo wakaru" are even correct Japanese. Whether they are or not
is not really our problem – what we need
to understand is that the function of
the ga never changes. It's always marking the doer or the be-er of the sentence. And
actually if you want to shuffle the
sentence around to make wakaru mean
understand, whether that's legitimate or
not, you will always have to throw the
ga somewhere else, onto the new actor of the sentence. Now, this may take a bit of
digesting, but when you do digest it
you're going to find that every Japanese
sentence works in the same way without
any need to memorize exceptions or
wonder what's going on in the sentence.
Now, there are a few more apparent
exceptions and they're all caused by the
same thing – by looking at Japanese
through English glasses. So in the next
few lessons we're going to look at the
main ones here: the tai form of verbs
and the so-called Japanese passive,
which is not in fact passive at all.
Remember that the course book for this
course of lessons is "Unlocking Japanese." You can get it at Amazon in Kindle and
paperback editions, and we recommend that you use the book in conjunction with
these lessons.
Thank you for attending again today.
